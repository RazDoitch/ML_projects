    "So far you only know few methods for classification: KNN, logistic regression and SVM. You can use each one of them. You can also use linear regression, but then you need to convert the output to 0s and 1s (this is not a straight forward use of linear regression but a possible one). You may want to choose which features to use (it could be that some features are not useful). Further, some features have missing values. You will need to decide how to handle this (for instance: drop rows with missing values, place an avergae value in those rows, or some other method of your choosing). Another matter to consider is handling non-numeric values. For example, sex is non-numeric. You may choose to drop non-numeric features, or you could convert them to numeric values (if such conversion makes sense).\n",
    "Also you will need to consider splitting the data into a training set and a test set so as to avoid tailoring the solution (overfitting) to the data you have.\n",

    "Your model needs to produce a prediciton for each data sample (row), which is 0 (did not survive) or 1 (survived). \n",

    "**Scoring your model**\n",

    "Your model performance will be assessed on test data that is not available to you. As mentioned above, this part of the project is a competition, where the goal is to achieve highest model accuracy\n",

    "**Final Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the project is open ended, in that you are not given small and specific tasks. However, you are already familiar with all the components needed to succeed. Specifically, reading data into pandas dataframe, dropping columns, dropping rows, changing value of features, splitting data into train and test subsets, performing model using sklearn library, and using cross validation. So don't panic...\n",
